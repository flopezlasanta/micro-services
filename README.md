# Micro-Services
Just another solution about MicroServices with Spring Boot, Netflix OSS, Docker...

## TODO

- [ ] use java alpine for dockerfiles
- [ ] upload docker compose
- [ ] create 2 profiles: dev (local) and prod (docker and cloud)
- [ ] use Thymeleaf for frontend views
- [ ] add Spring Security and Redis for user session
- [ ] add client-based load balancer (Netflix Ribbon)
- [ ] add server-based load balancer (Tutum HA Proxy)

**under construction!**
